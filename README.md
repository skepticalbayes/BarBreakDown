BarBreakDown
=============

BarBreakDown is a software used to detect rhymes and compute their lengths from rap lyrics.

Usage:

python bar_break_down.py

(Computes rhyme factor for each artist under 'lyrics_en' directory. See main() in bar_break_down.py for other options.)

You need to have eSpeak (http://espeak.sourceforge.net/) installed, if you want to analyze English lyrics for which phonetic transcription isn't available.
